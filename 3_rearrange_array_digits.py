Problem 3: Rearrange Array Elements

Rearrange Array Elements so as to form two number such that their sum is maximum.
Return these two numbers. You can assume that all array elements are in the range [0, 9]. The number
of digits in both the numbers cannot differ by more than 1. You are not allowed to use any built-in python sorting function.

Expected time complexity is O(nlog(n))
