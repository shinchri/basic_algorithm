# Explanation

## Reason for choice in data structure

Simple forloop is used to traverse the input array. The if-else is used to check the input value, and is appended to the respective lists. The lists are combined to form the output array.

## time complexity

Since it makes a single traversal, the run time is `O(n)`.

## space complexity

The space complexity is `O(1)` for input list.
