# Explanation

## Reason for choice in data structure

Simple forloop is used to traverse the input array. The if-else is used to check the input value, and is appended to the respective lists. The lists are combined to form the output array.

## time complexity

Since it makes a single traversal, the run time is `O(n)`.

## space complexity

The space complexity is `O(1)` since the memory taken by the sort_012 function does not depend on the input size. The input list is used as is, and no other list is created.
