# Explanation

## Reason for choice in data structure

The recursion is used since steps require similar computations.

The successive inputs are halved to meet the expected time complexity of `O(log(n))`.

## time complexity

Time complexity is `O(log(n))`.

## space complexity

Space complexity is `O(n)` since it is a recursive function.
