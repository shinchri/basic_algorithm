# Explanation

## Reason for choice in data structure

Trie is used because it is an efficient way to store a set of strings that have some common character(s).

## time complexity

The search and add takes `O(n)` where n is the length of the path list.

## space complexity

The space complexity is `O(skn)` where `s` is the length of the path, `k` is the length of the key, and `n` is the number of the keys.
