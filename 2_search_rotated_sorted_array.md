# Explanation

## Reason for choice in data structure

Recursion is used because the sub-problems are similar to the initial problem.

## time complexity

The time complexity is `O(long(n))`. This is reached by finding
the mid value from the input.

## space complexity

The space complexity is `O(n^2)`. This is because the input is an array, and there are recursive functions.
