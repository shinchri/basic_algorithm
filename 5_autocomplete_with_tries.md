# Explanation

## Reason for choice in data structure

Trie is used because it is a very efficient way of storing strings that have some common characters in them.

## time complexity

The insert and search takes `O(n)` where n is the length of the key.

## space complexity

The space complexity is `O(akn)` where a is the size of each alphabet, k is the length of the key and n is the number of the key.
