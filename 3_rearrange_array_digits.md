# Explanation

## Reason for choice in data structure

Here the heapsort is used to sort the input list. The heapsort is used because it has the worst case run time that meets the requirement.

## time complexity

The time complexity is `O(nlog(n))`. This is due to the run time of the heapsort.

## space complexity

The space complexity is `O(n)` from the input list.
