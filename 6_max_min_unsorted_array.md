# Explanation

## Reason for choice in data structure

A simple forloop is used to traverse through the input list.

## time complexity

The time complexity is `O(n)` since it makes a single traversal of the input array.

## space complexity

The space complexity is `O(1)`. This is because the memory used in the `get_max_min` method stays same regardless of what the input size is. The memory taken by the variables declared stay constant.
